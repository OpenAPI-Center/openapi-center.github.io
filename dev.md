## About

This is an Open source project, developed initially by one dev in free time.  
The ideas of features came up along development.  



## Techs

There are couple of distinct components.  
Mostly, it's a web application - therefore with backend and frontend.

### Back-end

* JVM based app, but not coded in Java
* Language: Kotlin
* Spring-boot
  - Spring-security
* Build tool: Gradle
* DB: has configurations for H2 and MySQL

### Front-end

* Angular (current: 14)
  * Angular-cli
* Typescript
* Nginx

...

### Other techs

#### Integrations

> https://github.com/OpenAPI-Center/oacenter-integration-support

There are plugins for Java projects.  

* Java
* Maven
* Gradle

### Ops

The application is distributed as containized environments.  
Techs related to the DevOps: 

* Docker
* Kubernetes
* Helm

## Considerations

This was spread tough through a long time (with about 2yrs break). 
That means that there is some tidiness to be done.  
But in general the project is well organized and uses recent/modern techs.  

Contributions are welcome.  
Please, preferably open PRs instead of issue reports. :)
