# OpenAPI Center

This is a set of tools composed of Self-hosted Web Application and plugins for communication with the server.  
Its aimed to software developers, testers, project managers and related areas.  

## Basic Idea

The server application is a centralized repository for all APIs from the organization.  
Its fed with the plugins, idealy during the build pipeline.  
The other features come on top of that, since we have the OpenAPI stored.  

## Easy Running

The simplest way to run it is through helm chart.   

1. Clone (or download as zip) the Ops repository on [Github](https://todo)  
2. Navigate to ... TODO

```shell
helm install openapicenter
```

## Code

The source is to be published on Github
